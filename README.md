### NAME: MIGUEL ANTONIO T. DAKAY
### COURSE AND YEAR: BSIT - 4

Hello! My name is Miguel, a BSIT student. As I am writing this, I don't really know
what to put about myself. I am just a student with different hobbies. Listening and singing along to music,
playing games, and practicing video editing. Doesn't seem much, but I take a lot of enjoyment in these hobbies. 
I always try to practice my programming whenever I can!

### NAME: KENT JOSE F. BAUSIN
### COURSE AND YEAR: BSIT - 3

Hello! My name is Kent, a BSIT-3 student. I enjoy reading novels and watching films, but my biggest time sink is playing gacha games, to an embarrassing degree. I used to sketch and do video editing, and even though I don’t as much anymore, I still enjoy the creativity of them. Sometimes I go off on random tangents like playing a new game or picking up a new skill or going down an internet rabbit hole for hours. You are focused on one thing, until you are not, and that is what I really like about having a variety of interests, you never know where they will lead you.
