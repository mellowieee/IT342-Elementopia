## NAME: MIGUEL ANTONIO T. DAKAY
## COURSE AND YEAR: BSIT - 4

Hello! My name is Miguel, a BSIT student. As I am writing this, I don't really know
what to put about myself. I am just a student with different hobbies. Listening and singing along to music,
playing games, and practicing video editing. Doesn't seem much, but I take a lot of enjoyment in these hobbies. 
I always try to practice my programming whenever I can!
